                    <h2>Marco Caldarulo</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a passionate professional with a strong background in private equity, infrastructure investments, and strategic advisory. Currently working at Boston Consulting Group as a Senior Consultant in the Principal Investors and Private Equity (PIPE) team, I have focused on value-add investments, financial modeling, and strategic project execution.
                        My career spans roles at leading firms such as Vesper Infrastructure Partners and the Department of Finance, Abu Dhabi, where I gained deep expertise in investment analysis, equity valuations, and fiscal strategy development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hold an MBA from INSEAD, with an exchange at CEIBS, and a Dual MSc in Management from Bocconi and ESSEC, where I graduated cum laude. In my spare time, I enjoy sailing, windsurfing, and exploring geopolitics and financial markets.
